// reduce
// map creates a new array by transforming every element in an array individually. filter creates a new array by removing elements that don't belong. reduce, on the other hand, takes all of the elements in an array and reduces them into a single value.

// reduce passes your callback four arguments:
// the current value
// the previous value 
// the current index
// the array you called reduce on

//where we can use reduce
